## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM (schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Auth**: JWT + bcrypt (production: add NextAuth.js)

## Production Setup

1. Provision PostgreSQL
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
3. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create tables
4. Replace `src/lib/store.ts` imports with Prisma client calls
5. Add authentication middleware

## Performance Overview Module

### Features
- **7 time ranges:** 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 7 years
- **4 chart views:** NOI trend, Revenue vs Expenses, Occupancy Rate, Expense Breakdown
- **AI narrative:** Powered by Anthropic claude-sonnet-4 — auto-generates 3-paragraph analysis of portfolio health, cost drivers, and recommendations
- **Cost Impact Events:** Categorized timeline of events (maintenance, vacancy, insurance, legal, CapEx, late payments, compliance) with positive/negative/neutral impact tagging
- **Period-by-period table:** Full breakdown per period with color-coded NOI margin and occupancy
- **KPI strip:** Revenue, NOI, Expenses, Occupancy, Vacancy Loss, CapEx — each with delta vs prior period

### Production setup
The API route (`/api/performance`) currently uses generated time-series data.  
In production, replace with Prisma aggregate queries against `PerformanceSnapshot`:

```typescript
// Example production query
const data = await prisma.performanceSnapshot.groupBy({
  by: ["period"],
  where: { companyId, granularity, period: { gte: startDate } },
  _sum: { revenue: true, expenses: true, noi: true, ... },
  orderBy: { period: "asc" },
});
```

Snapshots are written nightly by a cron job that aggregates:
- `RentPayment` records → revenue
- `WorkOrder.actualCost` + `CapitalProject.spent` → expenses
- `Lease.status` counts → occupancy rate
- `TrustTransaction` records → trust movement

### AI narrative
Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` to activate live AI summaries.
Falls back to a template-generated narrative when no key is present.
